    ## Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto
    
    As a practicing urban planner in the public sector for a large municipality, I expect that the theoretical questions of what it means to be a planner will intersect with how I prioritize and deliver my cartographic projects.  Throughout my academic and professional career, I have questioned a planner’s role as an advocate for democracy, a regulator of the free market, and a champion for economic growth.  The first point of the Floating Sheep Manifesto makes reference to the power maps have in creating and framing our ideas.  Maps can thus help urban planners make better decisions through the orientation and display of information from both contradictory and complimentary ideologies.  Planners can also benefit from the power of maps to help share information and facilitate project implementation.
    
    In order to process multiple perspectives, planners must also be able to contextualize the reality of the spaces they are examining and planning for.  As noted in the second point of the Floating Sheep Manifesto, the information that cartographers include in maps is most often biased to the insight of the map’s creator.  Planners who work in large metropolitan areas are tasked with considering multiple viewpoints from many people to make the best decisions.  In order to more thoroughly analyze data associated with a map or planning project, planners often question how to engage citizens to help inform a policy direction or development project that will benefit the greatest amount of people.  I therefore aspire to develop more critical perspectives about spatial relationships using cartography to inform more nuanced planning decisions.
